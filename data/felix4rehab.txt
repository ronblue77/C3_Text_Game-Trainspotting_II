FELIX IS IN REHAB YOU GO AND VISIT HIM HE COMES AND TELLS YOU HE DOESN'T WANT
TO BE FRIENDS WITH YOU ANYMORE THAT IT'S OVER "IF I WANT TO GET CLEAN I CAN'T BE FRIENDS WITH DRUG ADDICTS"
HE ASKS YOU TO LEAVE AND YOU GET MAD BUT YOU LEAVE...

ON ONE HAND YOU WISH HIM THE BE CLEAN FROM DRUGS ON THE OTHER YOU THINK HIS WHOLE REHAB IS BULLSHIT
AND YOU KNOW AFTER REHAB WITHIN 2 WEEKS HE'LL BE STONED AND HIGH ON DRUGS TWICE AS BEFORE
IF FELIX FOOLING HIMSELF THAT HE CAN BE CLEAN?
OR ARE YOU FOOLING YOURSELF TO BELIEVE YOU ARE A GOOD FRIEND OR PERSON?
