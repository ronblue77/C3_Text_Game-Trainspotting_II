		LEARNING TO LIVE...

A MONTH HAS PASSED... THE PHYSICAL WITHDRAWAL IS BETTER
NOW COMES THE HARD PART... LEARNING TO LIVE CLEAN
THEY TEACH YOU ABOUT JOBS, RESPONSIBILITY, STAYING AWAY FROM TRIGGERS

YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR FRIENDS STILL OUT THERE
USING, STEALING, DYING... YOU MISS THEM BUT CAN'T GO BACK
