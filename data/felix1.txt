YOU GO TO VISIT FELIX IN HIS APARTMENT... FELIX IS MEDITATING TO SOME SILLY NEW AGGIE MUSIC
FELIX ALSO TELLS YOU HE DECIDED TO EAT HEALTHY AND FROM NOW ON HE IS VEGAN ONLY
YOU LAUGH AND ASK HOW DOES THAT WORK WITH HIS DRUGS HABIT FELIX GETS MAD
"YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND DO YOU?" HE YELLS AT YOU "I'M GOING TO KICK THE HABIT OF DRUGS"
YOU ASK IF HE MEANS THAT HE'LL GO TO REHAB OR N.N. MEETINGS
FELIX ANSWERS HE DOESN'T BELIEVE IN THAT CRAP "I'LL GO COLD TURKEY" HE SAYS DEAD SERIOUS
YOU TELL HIM HE'S FOOLING HIMSELF AND WISH HIM GOOD LUCK
HE SAYS "FUCK YOU NICOLAS! MY DRUG HABIT IS MY PROBLEM AND I'LL GET MYSELF OUT OF IT
ON MY OWN JUST AS I PUTTED MYSELF INTO IT! AND IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME FUCK YOU!"
YOU WAIT TILL HE CHILL DOWN THEN YOU ASK HIM IF HE HAS A FIX FOR YOU...
"SORRY I DON'T" SAYS FELIX "I BARELY HAVE ENOUGH FOR MYSELF I DON'T HAVE A SPEAR FOR YOU"
YOU ARE SORRY YOU CAME TO VISIT - FELIX ALWAYS WAS A BIT OF A STUBBORN ASSHOLE...

YOU WISH HIM GOOD LUCK WITH THE WHATEVER AND LEAVE... BOY IT WAS A SHORT VISIT...
