		THE END...

THE MIRROR SHOWS WHAT'S LEFT OF YOU... A LIVING CORPSE
BONES VISIBLE UNDER DISEASED SKIN... EYES DEAD AND HOLLOW
YOUR BODY IS FAILING... YOUR MIND ALREADY GONE

THERE'S NOTHING LEFT TO LIVE FOR... NO HOPE, NO FUTURE
MAYBE IT'S TIME TO END IT... JOIN JOE IN THE DARKNESS
THE NEEDLE WAITS... ONE LAST TIME...
