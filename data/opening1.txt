		STARTING POINT...
		
IT'S 1991 AND YOU ARE A PICKLE FACED 16 TEENAGER NAMED NICOLAS
BUT EVERYONE CALLS YOU "NEEDLES POG"... CAUSE YOU ARE A TEENAGER JUNKIE

THAT'S RIGHT YOU ARE A HEROINE JUNKIE - YOU STEAL MONEY FROM YOUR PARENTS
OR FROM EVERYONE YOU CAN AND BUY DRUGS TO SHOOT DRUGS...

YOU ARE PART OF A 4 MEMBER GANG OF JUNKIES... MARY JOE FELIX AND YOU...
THE FOUR OF YOU KNOW EACH OTHER SINCE YOU WHERE LITTLE KIDS AND YOU GROW UP TOGETHER
NOW YOU ARE ALL A DRUG GANG OF JUNKIES... YOU DON'T GO TO SCHOOL YOU JUST EITHER
USE DRUGS TOGETHER OR YOU STEAL MONEY AND SHOP LIFT FROM STORES TO SELL AND BUY DRUGS

YOU ALL DON'T CARE MUCH FOR THE FUTURE ALL YOU CARE ABOUT IS YOUR NEXT FIX...
YOU LIVE FROM DAY TO DAY - SCHOOL HAS THROWN YOU OUT AND YOUR FAMILIES GAVE UP ON YOU ALL
THEY ARE JUST WAITING FOR YOU TO REACH AGE 18 AND KICK YOU OUT...

WHAT WILL BECOME OF YOU? GOD ONLY KNOWS
