		OVERDOSE...

YOU BOUGHT SOME HEROIN FROM A NEW DEALER... THE STUFF LOOKED DIFFERENT
BUT YOU WERE DESPERATE AND DIDN'T CARE... YOU SHOOT UP AS USUAL

SOMETHING IS WRONG... YOUR HEART IS RACING... YOU CAN'T BREATHE
EVERYTHING GOES BLACK...

YOU WAKE UP IN THE HOSPITAL... BRIGHT LIGHTS... WHITE CEILING
THE DOCTOR TELLS YOU YOU NEARLY DIED... IT WAS A BAD BATCH
MIXED WITH FENTANYL... YOU'RE LUCKY SOMEONE FOUND YOU IN TIME

YOUR PARENTS ARE THERE... CRYING... THEY BEG YOU TO GET HELP
YOU PROMISE TO DO BETTER... BUT THE CRAVING IS ALREADY STARTING...
