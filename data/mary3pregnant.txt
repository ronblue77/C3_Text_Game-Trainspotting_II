YOU MEET MARY... SHE TELLS YOU SHE'S PREGNANT BUT DON'T KNOW WHO THE FATHER IS...
SHE TELLS YOU IT COULD BE ANYONE EVEN YOU... YOU ASK HER WHAT SHE PLANS TO DO...
SHE TELLS YOU SHE DOESN'T KNOW... SHE LOOKS DEPRESSED AND SAD... AND ASK YOU TO LEAVE HER
YOU LEAVE...

AT THE END YOU HEAR FROM FRIENDS THAT MARY GAVE BIRTH TO A BABY BOY AND GAVE HIM FOR ADOPTION...
