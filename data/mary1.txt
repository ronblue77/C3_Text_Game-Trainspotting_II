YOU MEET MARY... SHE TELLS YOU SHE'S FINE
SHE LOOKS GREAT AND HAPPY... YOU BOTH GET STONED TOGETHER...
AND YOU SLEEP TOGETHER - BY MORNING YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE 
IN LOVE WITH HER... YOU BOTH GO OUT (YOU GOT MONEY) AND EAT AT A RESTAURANT...
YOU COME BACK AND SHOT SOME HEROINE AND SLEEP TOGETHER AGAIN ALL DAY...
YOU FEEL SO MUCH LOVE AND HAPPINESS... YOU FEEL YOU WANT TO STAY WITH HER FOREVER
NEXT DAY AT THE NIGHT YOU SAY GOODBYE AND YOU LEAVE...

YOU KNOW SHE IS THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE...
