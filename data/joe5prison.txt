		FAIR WELL JOE
		
JOE IN NOW SERVING 10 YEARS IN PRISON FOR ARMED RUBBERY...
YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU EVER SEE HIM AGAIN... YOU ARE AFRAID TO VISIT HIM
OR TO WRITE HIM OR CALL HIM... IF AND WHEN HE'LL BE RELEASED FROM PRISON IT WON'T BE THE SAME...
YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS WHO YOU WERE SO CLOSE TOO ARE NOW DRIFTING AWAY FROM EACH OTHER
EACH ONE GETS SCREWED ONE WAY OR THE OTHER - LIFE AS A JUNKIE IS NO GOOD FOR NOBODY...
WHEN YOU BEING REALISTIC YOU KNOW YOU WILL NEVER SEE JOE AGAIN...
IN 10 YEARS EITHER YOU OR HE OR BOTH OF YOU WILL BE DEAD BY THE WAY IT'S GOING
YOU ARE LOSING YOUR FRIENDS YOU ARE LOSING PERIOD... THERE IS NO FUTURE LIKE HE ONCE TOLD YOU
YOU SHOT HEROINE AND GET HIGH AND STONED 'FOR OLD TIMES SAKE' THAT'S ALL YOU CAN DO...
THAT'S ALL YOU GOT LEFT...
