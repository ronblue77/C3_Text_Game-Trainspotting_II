YOU GO MEET JOE... HE'S LIVING ON HIS OWN NOW...
YOU BRING HIM SOME FOOD AND CIGARETTES THE BRANDS HE LIKE...
HE OPEN THE DOOR AND SMILES... YOU HUG EACH OTHER AND HE INVITES YOU IN...
YOU ASK HOW IS HE DOING... 'I GET BY' HE REPLIES HIS PARENTS HELP HIM WITH MONEY
AFTER A FEW CHIT CHATS YOU BOTH GET HIGH AND STONED TILL THE EVENING
THEN YOU LISTEN TO OLD RECORDS - AND PREEMINENCE OLD MEMORIES FROM PAST
YOU TALK ABOUT MARY ABOUT FELIX ABOUT THE ASSHOLES FROM SCHOOL ABOUT YOUR FAMILIES
YOU TALK ABOUT OLD MOVIES AND TV SHOWS ABOUT MUSIC...

AFTER A FUN TIME TOGETHER YOU LEAVE - BUT YOU CAN'T HELP FEELING SAD
CAUSE YOU KNOW THAT ALL THIS WILL NOT LAST LONG IT CAN'T LAST LONG
YOU ALL ARE BARELY HANGING OUT THERE...
