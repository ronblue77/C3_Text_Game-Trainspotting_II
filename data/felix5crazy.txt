			SHINE ON YOU CRAZY DIAMOND

FELIX LOST HIS MIND... YOU ARE TOLD HE IS IN A PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL...
YOU WAIT TO SEE IF HE IS RELEASED FROM THE LUNACY BIN BUT MONTHS PASSES AND HE STILL THERE

YOU GO TO VISIT AND WHAT YOU SEE THERE TURNS YOUR INSIDES OUT... FELIX LOST ALL CONTACT WITH REALITY
HE IS PARANOID AND HE TALKS TO HIS VOICES THAT HE HEARS IN HIS MIND TELLING HIM HE IS GOD...
HE LOOKS AT YOU AND YELLS THAT YOU ARE A SECRET CIA AGENT AND THAT YOU CAME TO KILL HIM AND RUNS AROUND
THE NURSES CATCH HIM AND RESTRAIN HIM WHILE HE SINGS "SHINE ON YOU CRAZY DIAMOND" BY THE PINK FLOYD

YOU LOOK AT HIM AND HE IS JUST A HOLLOW SHELL OF WHAT HE USED TO BE - YOU ASK TO TALK TO THE STAFF
THE NURSES TELL YOU FELIX LOST FOREVER HIS SANITY AND THAT NO MEDICATION OR TREATMENT SEEM HELP HIM
HE IS ABOUT TO BE SENT TO A CLOSED HOSPITAL INSTITUTE WHERE HE WILL BE LOCKED UP FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE

YOU LEAVE HORRIFIED AND SHOCKED - YOU KNOW FELIX USED TO USE DRUGS AS A WAY TO HANDLE HIS MENTAL PROBLEMS
BUT YOU NEVER THOUGHT THIS COULD HAPPEN...

AS SOON AS YOU REACH HOME YOU GET STONED AND HIGH TO FORGET WHAT YOU SAW -
BUT STILL NO SHOT OF DRUG CAN MAKE YOU STOP THINKING ABOUT IT
