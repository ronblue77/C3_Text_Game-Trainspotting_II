		GROUP THERAPY...

SITTING IN A CIRCLE WITH OTHER ADDICTS... SHARING STORIES
YOU TELL THEM ABOUT MARY, JOE, AND FELIX... YOUR LIFE ON THE STREETS
SOME CRY, SOME NOD IN UNDERSTANDING... THEY'VE BEEN THERE TOO

THE THERAPIST HELPS YOU UNDERSTAND YOUR TRIGGERS
MAYBE THERE'S HOPE AFTER ALL... IF YOU CAN STAY STRONG
