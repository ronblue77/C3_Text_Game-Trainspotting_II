		THE FINAL CHOICE

In the end, Nicolas couldn't bear the weight of his choices anymore.
The reflection in the mirror had become unbearable,
each glance a reminder of everything he'd lost.

With trembling hands, he prepared his last hit.
This time, he didn't measure carefully.
This time, he didn't want to wake up.

They found him days later, needle still in his arm,
a ghost of the person he once was.
No more pain, no more struggles, no more reflections.

Just silence.
Just darkness.
Just the end.

Another life lost to the merciless grip of addiction...
