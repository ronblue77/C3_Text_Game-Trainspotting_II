YOU MEET JOE AT THE REHAB CENTER HIS PARENTS SENT HIM TO
AFTER HE NEARLY DIED FROM OVERDOSE... HE'S BEEN THERE FOR 6 MONTHS

HE LOOKS PILE AND FAT AND DEPRESSED... YOU TRY TO CHEER HIM UP...
HE SAYS HE IS JUST WAITING TO GET OUT OF HERE SO HE CAN GET HIGH AGAIN...
HE SAYS HE DOESN'T MIND DYING FROM OVERDOSE... OR GOING TO JAIL FOR LIFE...
HE SAYS LIKE SUCKS WITHOUT HEROINE AND DRUGS...
HE SAYS HE IS SAD HE'S PARENTS SAVED HIS LIFE AND THAT HE IS ALIVE...
THE DOCTORS PUTTED HIM ON PSYCHIATRIC MEDICATIONS THAT HE HATES...
HE TELLS YOU HIS LIFE IS A MESS AND THE MORE PEOPLE TRY TO HELP THEY MAKE IT WORSE...
HE CALLS REHAB "A BLUFF" HE SAYS "ONCE A JUNKIE ALWAYS A JUNKIE"
YOU ASK HIM ABOUT HIS FUTURE...
HE REPLIES "I HAVE NO FUTURE I DON'T CARE ABOUT ANYTHING I JUST WANT TO GET HIGH OR DIE TRYING"

YOU LEAVE HIM AND YOU HEAR AFTER A WHILE HE IS RELEASED FROM REHAB AND BACK USING DRUGS
NOTHING CHANGED - NOTHING EVER CHANGE - ONCE YOU ARE FUCKED YOU STAY THAT WAY TILL YOU DIE...
