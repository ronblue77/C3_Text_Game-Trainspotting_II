		MARY RIP

MARY DIED FROM AN OVERDOSE - SHE WAS BURIED IN A SMALL FUNERAL...
YOU ATTENDED THE FUNERAL WITH TEARS IN YOUR EYES AND FOR WEEKS AFTER YOU
COULDN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT HER... THE MEMORIES FROM HER - HER SWEET LOVE
HOW BEAUTIFUL HER SOUL WAS HOW GOOD SHE WAS TO YOU - AND HOW MUCH YOU WILL MISS HER
NOW THAT SHE IS GONE... YOU WISH YOU COULD HOLD HER JUST ONE MORE TIME
YOU WISH YOU COULD TELL HER HOW MUCH YOU LOVED HER AND HOW MUCH YOU MISS HER
THE TIME YOU HAD TOGETHER THE LOVE YOU SHARED - SHE WAS THE KINDEST PERSON YOU KNEW
AND KNOWING YOU'LL HAVE TO CONTINUE WITHOUT HER IS UNBEARABLE...
YOU GET HIGH ON DRUGS AND DREAM YOU ARE WITH HER IN HEAVEN

YOU KNOW YOU'LL MEET HER THERE ONE DAY SO YOU HOPE...
