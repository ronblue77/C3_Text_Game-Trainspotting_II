YOU MEET JOE ON A SATURDAY NIGHT... HE LOOKS GOOD
YOU WATCH SOME TV THEN YOU GO OUT AND PLAY SOME POOL AND DRINK A FEW BEERS
THEN YOU COME BACK AND SHOT SOME HEROINE AND GET STONED TILL THE MORNING...
YOU BOTH WAKE US AND IT'S SUNDAY MORNING - YOU HEAR THE BELLS OF THE NEARBY CHURCH

JOE IS YOUR BEST FRIEND FOREVER - THERE IS NOTHING YOU DON'T TELL EACH OTHER
YOU BOTH TRUST EACH OTHER AND LOYAL TO EACH OTHER... THE WAY IT WAS MEANT TO BE...

YOU STAY TOGETHER FOR THE DAY LISTENING TO ZIGGY STARDUST RECORD AND SMOKING CIGARETTES...
AND AT EVENING YOU LEAVE...
