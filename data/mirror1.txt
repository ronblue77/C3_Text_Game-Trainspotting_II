		REFLECTION...

YOU LOOK IN THE MIRROR... STILL LOOKING GOOD
YOUNG, HEALTHY, FULL OF LIFE... THE DRUGS HAVEN'T LEFT THEIR MARK YET
YOUR EYES ARE BRIGHT, YOUR SKIN IS CLEAR
MARY SAYS YOU'RE THE MOST HANDSOME GUY SHE KNOWS

SURE, YOU'RE AN ADDICT... BUT YOU'RE MANAGING IT
YOU CAN STOP ANYTIME YOU WANT... OR SO YOU TELL YOURSELF
