		GAME OVER

In the gritty streets of Edinburgh, another soul has been claimed
by the merciless grip of heroin addiction.

Nicolas Renton's story ends here - another cautionary tale
in the endless cycle of addiction and despair.

His friends will mourn.
His family will grieve.
But the city moves on, unchanged, uncaring.

Somewhere in Leith, another young soul takes their first hit,
and the cycle begins anew...

Choose Life.
Choose a job.
Choose a career.
Choose a family...

But Nicolas chose another path,
and paid the ultimate price.

		THE END
