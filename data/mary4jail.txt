YOU GO VISIT MARY IN JAIL... SHE SERVES SIX MONTHS SENTENCE IN PRISON
SHE GOT CAUGHT STEALING FOOD... SHE IS SAD BUT HAPPY TO SEE YOU...
SHE IS NOT DOING SO WELL SHE HAS NO IDEA WHAT SHE IS GOING TO DO WITH HERSELF WHEN
SHE IS RELEASED... SHE TELLS YOU SHE GOT NOTHING AND NOBODY... NO ONE VISITS HER
YOU ASK HOW SHE IS DOING IN JAIL... SHE TELLS YOU IT'S FULL OF DRUGS AND GANGS
SHE TRIED TO GET 'CLEANED' FROM DRUGS BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE IN JAIL...
YOU PROMISE HER TO VISIT HER WHEN YOU CAN AND WISH HER TO STAY STRONG

YOU LEAVE FEELING SAD...
