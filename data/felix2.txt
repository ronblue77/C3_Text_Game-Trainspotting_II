YOU VISIT FELIX IN HIS CRAPPY APARTMENT... IT SEEM FELIX IS SLOWLY SELLING HIS PROPERTIES
TO GET THE MONEY HE NEEDS FOR DRUGS... FELIX EATS CHEAP CEREAL WITH LOW FAT MILK...
NO MORE NEW AGE MUSIC SINCE HE PROBABLY SOLD HIS ALBUMS AND DC PLAYER AND EVERYTHING...
EACH TIME YOU VISIT HIM THERE IS LESS STUFF IN THE APARTMENT THAT HIS PARENTS GAVE HIM

ANYWAY YOU WAIT PATIENTLY FOR HIM TO FINISH EATING HIS CEREAL AND THEN ASK HIM IF HE WANTS TO GET HIGH
HE THINKS ABOUT IT AND AGREES - AFTER 20 MINUTES YOU BOTH ARE STONED AND HIGH ON HEROINE...

YOU WAKE UP OUTSIDE FELIX APARTMENT ON THE PAVEMENT AT NIGHT AND MONEY FROM YOUR WALLET BEEN STOLEN
YOU GET UP AND KNOCK ON FELIX DOOR BUT GET NO ANSWER... YOU WALK AWAY ANGRY 
- FELIX CAN BE SUCH AN ASSHOLE SOMETIMES... TO BE HONEST YOU DON'T KNOW WHY YOU ARE FRIENDS WITH HIM...
