FELIX GOT 10 MONTHS IN JAIL FOR PICK POCKETS IN THE METRO
YOU GO VISIT HIM - FELIX IS ANGRY "SO YOU CAME TO SEE ME IN JAIL HUM?
SO YOU CAN FEEL GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF" YOU TELL HIM THAT DESPITE HE WAS A GRAND ASSHOLE
TOWARDS YOU YOU STILL CARE ABOUT HIM AND YOU WISH HIM ONLY THE BEST
FELIX STARTS TO CRY AND SAYING HE WISH HE WASN'T BORN AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO HIM
YOU ASK HIM HOW IS PRISON FOR HIM HE JUST SAYS "IT'S HELL I'M IN HELL AND NOBODY CARES NOT EVEN YOU"
YOU ASK IF THERE'S SOMETHING YOU CAN DO TO HELP HIM FEEL BETTER HE ASKS THAT YOU SEND HIM A PHOTOGRAPH
OF A BUDDHA STATUE SO HE CAN TRY TO MEDITATE WITH IT WHILE HE IS HERE...

YOU LEAVE AND THE NEXT WEEK YOU SEND HIM A LETTER WITH A PHOTO OF BUDDHA AND A NOTE SAYING
"DEAR FELIX I HOPE YOU WILL BE WELL AND THAT THIS WILL HELP YOU... YOUR FRIEND NICOLAS"
